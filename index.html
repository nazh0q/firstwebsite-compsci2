        <h2>Who  Is Naz?</h2>
        <p>Naz is a cultured human being living in Brookyln, North America. He is 17. He lives in an apartment with his fam/cat.
           He likes to ride his bike in the city and likes to eat, alot.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What Does Naz Like?</h2>
        <p>
            Naz is interested in binge watching, edgy or classical memes (depends on the day of the week), 
            listening to any kind of music, riding his bike to random parts of NYC, 
            and being smart for no reason when no one asks him to. 
            (He's kind of an arrogrant loser.)
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>What Is His Coding Experience?</h2>
        <p>
            Naz has always had an intrest for coding. He learned to code since middle school from
            YoutTube tutorials and what ever free boot camps are online. 
            (Did you think I'll actually pay to code?)
            The first language that he learned was Python 2 and Ruby? 
            Later on he learned HTML/CSS 
            (They're not actually coding languages; they're markup, but you know what I mean), 
            Java, Angular, Node.js, Pyhton3, Express, Go, Laravel, 
            and being an arrogant loser again.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What Does Naz Aspire For?</h2>
        <p>
            Naz is pretty much dead inside, but sometimes he has hopes and aspirations. 
            He hopes to be a back-end/ full-stack developer working either free lance or for a company.
            (In normal terms I want to work in the behind the scenes of things without havong to stress over specifics.)
            If he gets the motivation to, he hopes to develop his start-up further than it is currently.
            The gist of it is that I want them fat stacks ya huuurd!
